Kevin/Chris:

Hi! Read mainprogram.py for the overall structure of the program. Still some work to be done, but I've
put a lot of comments throughout that will hopefully help bring this together.


The only important files currently here are jsonClass.py, TNY_COMMIT1.py, and mainprogram.py. 

Everything else is irrelevant.
