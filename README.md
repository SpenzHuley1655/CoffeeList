Kevin/Chris:

Hi! Read mainprogram.py for the overall structure of the program. Still some work to be done, but I've
put a lot of comments throughout that will hopefully help bring this together.


The only important files currently here are jsonClass.py, TNY_COMMIT1.py, and mainprogram.py. Everything else is irrelevant. 

Haven't had time to work out the nuances of the Google Calendar API.
Chris, I hope that you have more luck deciphering some of the notes that they use to explain things.

Please call/email me if this gets confusing. Sorry for not being able to flesh it out anymore than I have.
